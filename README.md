# saySo

this time, the reason why i am opening this repo, is to get famaliar with git.

that is something i learnt again and again, so this time i want to record, the brief use of the git.

overall it is a amazing tool. 

(by the way i look down upon who is enshusiastic about design a html using html and ccs, but if turning to visual design, i respect it again)

### brief use of git

git clone

git add .

git status

git commit  -m "something you wnat to say"

git push

thoses are main uses, also i come want to brief the vim also


















### old readme
this is the old readme, i have no idea what i was planing to do in the name of the project saySo. but it is a little beautifule
